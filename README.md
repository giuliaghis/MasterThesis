# Master's Thesis: Perception and Use of Generative AI Tools by Students in Academic Contexts

# Overview
This repository contains all materials related to my Master's thesis, which investigates the perception and use of Generative AI (GenAI) tools by students in an academic context. The study explores how students understand, interact with, and leverage these tools for academic purposes, including writing, research, and problem-solving. The research aims to provide insights into the implications of GenAI tools in education, their potential benefits, and the challenges associated with their usage.

# Repository Contents
Dataset: The final dataset used for the analysis, containing all data collected in raw format. This dataset is structured and prepared for replication of results or further analysis.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Code for the exploratory data analysis of the dataset, providing initial insights, visualizations, and statistical summaries. The analysis was initially developed in a Jupyter Notebook and has been exported as a Python script (.py file) for easier access and version control.

Analysis of Relationships Between Variables: Code and documentation that detail the investigation into the relationships between various variables within the dataset. This section includes correlation analyses and visual representations to understand how different factors interact and impact each other.

Figures and Visualizations: A folder containing all figures, graphs, and visualizations created during the EDA and further analysis phases. These visuals are used to support the findings presented in the thesis document.
